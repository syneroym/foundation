# Syneroym foundational documents


This repository is the central home for Syneroym’s vision, conceptual groundwork, design principles, RFCs, and long-term architectural decisions. It exists to keep the project’s intent, philosophy, and technical direction aligned as the ecosystem grows.

<!--

If you're new here, start by understanding the ideas, then explore the proposals and decisions that shape the system.

## 📚 Repository Structure

### `00-index/`
Orientation materials for new readers — how to navigate the foundation, glossary, and quick-start references.

### `vision/`
High-level narrative: manifesto, mission, goals, and multi-stage roadmap for Syneroym.

### `concepts/`
Explainers and foundational ideas: synergetic exchange, value-flow models, p2p commons thinking, and other design philosophies.

### `rfcs/`
Requests for Comments — proposals under discussion. This is where ideation happens.
Each RFC moves through the lifecycle: **Draft → Proposed → Accepted/Rejected**.

### `adrs/`
Architecture Decision Records — finalized technical decisions with context and consequences.

### `standards/`
Coding conventions, API contracts, security guidelines, and other shared norms across the ecosystem.

### `examples/`
Reference patterns, integrations, or illustrative scenarios relevant to Syneroym’s architecture or concepts.

### `governance/`
Project governance: roles, contribution process, review policies, and decision-making mechanisms.

### `research/`
Background notes, annotated papers, experiment logs, and exploratory investigations.

### `assets/`
Diagrams, images, and shared visual materials.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. Open an Issue if you want to discuss a concept, propose an idea, or start an RFC.
2. For formal proposals, create a draft in `rfcs/` using the RFC template.
3. Submit a Pull Request for review.
4. After discussion and iteration, maintainers will move RFCs into **Accepted**, **Rejected**, or **Superseded** states.
5. ADRs should only be added or updated once a decision crystallizes.

Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full contribution workflow.

## 🔍 Purpose of This Repository

This foundation is the canonical source of truth for:

- Syneroym’s philosophical grounding  
- System-level goals and principles  
- Standards and conventions across the ecosystem  
- Open proposals and architectural decisions  
- Shared understanding of how the pieces work together  

If a question comes up about *why* Syneroym works the way it does, the answer should live here.
