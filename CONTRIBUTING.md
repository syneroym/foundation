### Commit message style

We keep commit messages short and descriptive. Use the pattern `scope: short description` where useful.

Examples:
- `docs: elaborate contribution guidelines`
- `ideas: update context summary for LLM`

PR titles and descriptions are the primary place for context; please include a short summary and link to relevant issues/RFCs.
